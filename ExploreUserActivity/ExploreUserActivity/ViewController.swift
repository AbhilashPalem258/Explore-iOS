 Notes:
 - An NSUserActivity object provides a lightweight way to capture the state of your app and put it to use later.
 
 - If SiriKit needs to launch your app for any reason, it creates a user activity object and assigns an appropriate INInteraction object to its interaction property. You can also provide SiriKit with a custom user activity object containing additional data that you want passed to your app
